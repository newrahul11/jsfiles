                                    The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a
                                    muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy
                                    tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger
                                    than females and have a prominent mane.
                                    The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal
                                    than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at
                                    twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and
                                    Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented
                                    populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been
                                    listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African
                                    countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are
                                    untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is
                                    not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes
                                    for concern.
